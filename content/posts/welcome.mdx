# Welcome to My New Blog

I'm excited to start fresh with this new setup! After using Gatsby for a few years, I've migrated to Next.js for faster builds and better developer experience.

## What You'll Find Here

This blog is designed around three main areas:

### Life Insights
Personal reflections, lessons learned, and thoughts on various topics that interest me.

### Data Visualizations
Interactive charts and data stories. Here's a simple example:

```jsx
import { LineChart, Line, XAxis, YAxis, CartesianGrid, Tooltip, ResponsiveContainer } from 'recharts'

const data = [
  { month: 'Jan', posts: 2 },
  { month: 'Feb', posts: 4 },
  { month: 'Mar', posts: 3 },
  { month: 'Apr', posts: 6 },
]

export default function PostsChart() {
  return (
    <ResponsiveContainer width="100%" height={300}>
      <LineChart data={data}>
        <CartesianGrid strokeDasharray="3 3" />
        <XAxis dataKey="month" />
        <YAxis />
        <Tooltip />
        <Line type="monotone" dataKey="posts" stroke="#2563eb" strokeWidth={2} />
      </LineChart>
    </ResponsiveContainer>
  )
}
```

### Career Projects
A portfolio showcasing my work, experiments, and learning journey.

## The Tech Stack

This blog is built with:
- **Next.js 14** - Fast builds and great developer experience
- **MDX** - Markdown with React components
- **Tailwind CSS** - Rapid styling
- **Recharts** - Data visualizations
- **Vercel** - Free hosting with automatic deployments

## What's Next

I'm planning to write regularly about:
- Data analysis projects
- Career insights and lessons
- Technical experiments
- Personal growth and reflections

The goal is to make updating this blog as frictionless as possible, so I can focus on creating content rather than fighting with the tooling.

Thanks for reading, and stay tuned for more posts!
